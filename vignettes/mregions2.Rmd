mregions2 allows to access the [Marine Regions Gazetteer](https://marineregions.org/gazetteer.php) and the [Marine Regions Data Products](https://marineregions.org/sources.php) in R.

# What's Marine Regions?

[Marine Regions](https://marineregions.org/) is part of the [LifeWatch project](https://www.lifewatch.be/). Its activities  focus on two main outputs: The [Marine Regions Gazetteer](https://marineregions.org/gazetteer.php) and the [Marine Regions Data Products](https://marineregions.org/sources.php).

The [Marine Regions Gazetteer](https://marineregions.org/gazetteer.php) is a standard list of marine georeferenced place names.

> Gazetteer: a dictionary of geographical names. 

<sup>https://www.thefreedictionary.com/gazetteer</sup>

All geographic objects of the Marine Regions Gazetteer database have a unique ID, named the [**MRGID**](https://marineregions.org/mrgid.php)

> Syntax `http://marineregions.org/mrgid/<number>`

<sup>E.g. https://marineregions.org/mrgid/3293</sup>

In addition to the Marine Regions Gazetteer, the Marine Regions Team creates and hosts geographical Data Products, being the most popular one the [Marine Regions Maritime Boundaries](https://marineregions.org/eez.php).

# What's mregions2?

mregions2 aims to retrieve marine geospatial information from the [Marine Regions Gazetteer](https://marineregions.org/gazetteer.php?p=webservices) and access the  [Marine Regions Data Products](https://marineregions.org/sources.php).

The mregions2 package makes this difference clear from the naming of its functions:
* Gazetteer functions: `gaz_*()`
* Data Products functions: `mrp_()*`

These differences are not trivial as mregions2 uses different methods to access the Marine Regions Gazetteer than the Marine Regions Data Products: the Marine Regions Gazetteer is accessible using [RESTful methods](https://www.marineregions.org/gazetteer.php?p=webservices) with `gaz_search()`. The Marine Regions Data Products can be accessed using [OGC Web Services](https://www.marineregions.org/webservices.php). They are hosted at the [Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) geoserver](https://geo.vliz.be): 

> `http://geo.vliz.be/`

They can be visualized via [Web Map Services (WMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service) with `mrp_view()` or downloaded by [Web Feature Services (WFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service) with `mrp_get()`

# Why mregions2 instead of mregions?
mregions2 supersedes {`mregions`}. The need of mregions2 is further explained in `vignette("why_mregions2")`


>**NOTE**
>
> The naming `mrp_*()` instead of `mr_()` was decided to avoid overlapping with the functions from {`mregions`}
